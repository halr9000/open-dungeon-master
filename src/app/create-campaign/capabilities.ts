// up in the usual order (storyteller first, pictures later) would otherwise
// make every early campaign map-less and keep it so after pictures arrive
// (src/lib/image-backend-rescue.ts). What the person wanted is returned
// beside it, so saving defaults during an outage saves their choice, not the
