// falling net: "A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength
// check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success."
//
// The hold is kept by the engine (its instance names the trap as its
// source), so the model cannot lift it with clear_condition
// (src/lib/dm/ai-gate.ts); this is the action that does, through
// take_action escape, as a grapple and a spell's hold are escaped.
