// What the guided setup suggests for pictures and narration, from what the
// admin already chose for the storyteller and what the scan found running
// here. The one rule underneath: reuse what is already set up. An agent
// that narrates and can paint paints too, on the same sign-in; an OpenAI key
// given for the story covers pictures, narration and dictation; a ComfyUI or
// Kokoro already running on this machine is free and private. Suggestions
// only mark a card and fill an unanswered step: nothing is saved until the
// admin presses Continue, and "Skip for now" saves nothing at all.
// Pure, so scripts/test-setup-wizard.mjs checks each one.
